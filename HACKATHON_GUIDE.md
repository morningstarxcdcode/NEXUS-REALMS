## üé® Asset Creation Strategy

### Optimized Asset Pipeline
```bash
# Texture Optimization
- Use WebP format for textures (70% smaller than PNG)
- Maximum texture size: 1024x1024
- Use texture atlases to reduce draw calls

# 3D Model Optimization
- Use glTF 2.0 format for models
- Target <10k triangles per model
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) system

# Audio Optimization
- Use OGG Vorbis format (smaller than MP3)
- Compress to 128kbps for music, 64kbps for effects
- Use 3D positional audio sparingly
```

### Quick Asset Sources
- **3D Models**: Sketchfab (CC licensed), Mixamo (characters)
- **Textures**: Freepbr.com, CC0Textures.com
- **Audio**: Freesound.org, Zapsplat (with account)
- **UI Icons**: Feather Icons, Heroicons

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture
```javascript
// Entity-Component-System Pattern
const player = game.createEntity('player');
game.addComponent(player.id, 'transform', { position: [0,0,0] });
game.addComponent(player.id, 'render', { model: 'warrior.glb' });
game.addComponent(player.id, 'stats', { health: 100, mana: 50 });
```

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Automatic quality scaling based on FPS
if (game.engine.getStats().fps < 30) {
    game.engine.setQualityLevel('medium');
}

// Object pooling for frequently created objects
const bulletPool = new ObjectPool(Bullet, 100);
```

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
```javascript
// Input handling for multiple devices
const inputManager = {
    keyboard: new KeyboardHandler(),
    mouse: new MouseHandler(),
    touch: new TouchHandler(),
    gamepad: new GamepadHandler()
};
```

## üéÆ Gameplay Features Implementation

### Multiple Endings System
```javascript
// Dynamic ending calculation
const availableEndings = storyEngine.checkAvailableEndings();
// Based on: karma, relationships, quests completed, secrets found

const endings = {
    hero: { karma: 75+, allies: 3+, quests: 25+ },
    villain: { karma: -50+, power: 80+, enemies: 100+ },
    neutral: { karma: ¬±25, balance: true },
    secret: { hiddenAreas: 10+, secretItems: 15+ },
    true: { allEndingsSeen: true, masteryLevel: 100 }
};
```

### Economy System
```javascript
// Multi-currency with dynamic pricing
const economySystem = new EconomySystem();
economySystem.currencies = {
    gold: { value: 1000, icon: 'ü™ô' },
    essence: { value: 0, icon: '‚ú®' },
    reputation: { value: 50, icon: '‚≠ê' }
};

// Investment system
economySystem.makeInvestment('merchant_guild', 1000, 'gold');
// Returns 15% after 5 minutes real-time
```

### Character Progression
```javascript
// Class-based system with unique abilities
const classes = {
    warrior: { 
        abilities: ['Sword Mastery', 'Shield Wall', 'Berserker Rage'],
        uniqueFeature: 'Weapon Combo System'
    },
    mage: {
        abilities: ['Elemental Magic', 'Teleportation', 'Time Manipulation'],
        uniqueFeature: 'Spell Crafting'
    }
};
```
